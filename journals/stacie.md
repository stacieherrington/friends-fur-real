Today we worked on accounts as a group. On my own, I created an api to get
location coordinates from an account's address. I had an aha moment regarding
organization of the code.

Today we got so much done. We did pet update as a group, then we worked
individually on issues we created. I worked on the Rescue model and all
the CRUD functionality for rescue. I then helped Kate with some logic for
success story list by rescue.

Today we worked as a whole group again and we got started with our pet models/queries/routers.

Rather than one aha moment, it was a whole day of learning FastAPI and MongoDB.

Today as a whole group we worked on setup--the yaml file and the Dockerfiles. We also created our database volumes and installed MongoDB Compass.

It was really cool to get all the Docker containers running!
