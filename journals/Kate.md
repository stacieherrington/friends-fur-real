Today, I worked on:

* Setting up the Docker yaml file and installed MongoDB Compass. 

The team tested if the application/host was running and it worked!

Getting all the docker files and images to work is amazing! Also finding out that adding '[all]' on the fastapi requirements includes any fastapi dependencies. Which is pretty cool!
